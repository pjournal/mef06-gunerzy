Using foreign students by nationality data I have constructed a shiny app which gives a bar chart of total number of foreign students by the top 5 common nationality. The table can be filtered by province and/or by the university type.

My shiny app link is [here](https://gunerzy.shinyapps.io/foreign_students_shiny_app/).

It can also be accessed from the code below.

```{{r}}
library(shiny)
shiny::runGitHub("pjournal/mef06-gunerzy",subdir="Shiny app assignment/foreign_students_shiny_app/")
```
